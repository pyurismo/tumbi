In this wiki page we will try to list the features that
nsp lacks for a first public version, or in other words
what should be "nsp base". The list should not be too
long so as the lacking features could be implemented,
says, before the end of this year.If you think that 
nsp really needs such feature or want to comment about
already listed ones you could post a message at the end
of this page.
