# some nsp features related to images

== load an image in nsp from a file ==

Use the `gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file`:
{{{
  im = gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file(image_file_name);
}}}

usual image formats (png, jpg, gif, bmp,...) are supported. 

== the nsp image type in nsp ==

The loaded image im is a nsp object of type GdkPixbuf :

type(im,"string")
ans	=		s (1x1)

  GdkPixbuf

In the following we also call such object "nsp images" (but
GdkPixBuf is the real name). 

You could test if `im` is a "nsp image" using:
{{{
   type(im,"string") == "GdkPixbuf"
}}}
 or with the `is` function:
{{{
  is(im,%types.GdkPixbuf)
}}}

== nsp methods related to the image type ==

 There are some methods which apply on such object, alas not already documented (this page is a first try) but are nsp equivalent of methods defined in gdk for such objects. You can have a look at the gdk pixbuffer documentation:

[http://library.gnome.org/devel/gdk-pixbuf/stable]

 Some (basic) examples:

{{{
W = im.get_width[]
H = im.get_height[]
bool = im.get_has_alpha[]
L = im.get_bits_per_sample[]
}}}

 Another one which lets to create a new image by scaling:

{{{
im_new = im.scale_simple[W/2,H/2,"GDK_INTERP_BILINEAR"]
}}}

You can have an overview of all available methods in nsp with:
{{{
im.get_method_names[]  
}}}
or better with:
{{{
 im.get_method_names[0] 
}}}
to get methods specific for these objects (and not methods herited from father object classes).
 
== get R, G, B and alpha matrices from a nsp image ==

You can get R, G, B (and alpha channel if any) using:
{{{
 C = pixbuftocells(im)
}}}

`C{1},C{2},C{3}` are R,G,B matrices with intensities values (integers between [0,255])
If the alpha channel is present (that is if `im.get_has_alpha[]` return TRUE) a fourth
matrix `C{4}` is present. Currently these matrices are Mat object that is made of double precision numbers.

== create a nsp image from R, G, B and alpha matrices ==

 The `cellstopixbuf` function lets to create an image from 3 matrices (or 4 if the alpha channel is provided) :
{{{
 im = cellstopixbuf(C)
}}}
  where `C` is an arrays of (3 or 4) cells which are matrices (all of same size and all with integer values between 0 and 255). These array of cells could be build with:
{{{
  C = { R, G, B };   // or C = { R, G, B, A };
}}}
 
== save a nsp image to a file ==

Use the `save` method:
{{{
im.save[ file_name, type]
}}}
 
Example: 
{{{
im.save["toto.png","png"]
}}}

== display a nsp image ==

In nsp near all gtk widget are interfaced so it is possible to display images in various ways. You could have a look at the gtk2 nsp demonstration scripts (`nsp2/demos/gtk2`). There is no quick and easy image visualization function, so here is a very basic one you can complete/adapt to your needs.

{{{
function very_basic_image_draw(im, maxsize=1000, title="")

   // im: image (pixbuf) to draw
   // maxsize: limit the max size of the image to maxsize pixels
   // title: a scalar string window title 

   if ( ~is(im,%types.GdkPixbuf) ) then
      error("first argument should be an image (a GdkPixbuf object)")
   end
   window = gtkwindow_new()
   window.set_title[title]
   window.set_border_width[4]
   frame = gtkframe_new();
   // limit max size of the image to maxsize
   w = im.get_width[]
   h = im.get_height[]
   if max(w,h) > maxsize then
      // scale the image to limit its max size to maxsize
      if w >= h then
         new_w = maxsize;
	 new_h = round(maxsize*h/w)
      else
         new_h = maxsize
         new_w = round( maxsize*w/h)
      end
      im = im.scale_simple[new_w,new_h,"GDK_INTERP_BILINEAR"]       
   end
   frame.add[gtkimage_new("pixbuf",im)];
   window.add[frame]
   window.show_all[]
endfunction
