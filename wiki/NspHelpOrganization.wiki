#summary discussion about how to organize the nsp help

<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

=organization=

==introduction==
Here is a proposal for help organization (to be completed, don't hesitate !). Currently some chapters of this proposal don't yet exist (and waiting for such an organization we have put many help pages in a "misc chapter").

Remarks:
  * a help page could be referenced by several chapters (for instance the umfpack page is referenced both by the data type and the linear algebra chapters).
  * In fact the "summary page" of each chapter should be written by hand and this lets an additionnal freedom to organize the chapter presentation.
  * a page (which is a latex file) can contain the description of several functions (examples: min, max, minmax functions, sum and prod functions, complex, real, imag functions).
  * functions/methods/topics already documented are ~~strikeout~~ (but the corresponding help page could be completed and improved in many cases).
  * many functions already in nsp have not been yet referenced in this note (work in progress, don't hesitate to complete this note).

=latex help related explanations=

The nsp help is build from latex pages. It is converted in html using 
Eitan Gurary [http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/TeX4ht/mn.html ht4latex] code.

This section _needs certainly supplementary explanations_

==tricks==

The file `nsp2/man/src/model/model.tex` gives several tricks. In particular there are different ways to introduce nsp code but we recommend to use the `Verbatim` (note the upper case V) which is much much simpler than using \begin{program} \HCode, etc...):

{{{
\begin{Verbatim}
my lines of nsp code just as if it
is in its own text file
\end{Verbatim}
}}}

Caution: currently there are some problems of copy-paste inside the nsp command window with webkit-gtk as help browser (due to some coding of the blank char).

==the summary chapter file==

These source files are located in `nsp2/man/src/`. Once you have wrote an help page (to place in a `nsp2/man/src/chapter_name` directory) you should add two entries (an hyperlink and an input command) inside its corresponding summary chapter file (generally `nsp2/man/src/chapter_name.tex`). See one of these files.

==compilation==

Different solutions:
  * in `nsp2/man/html/generated`, enter `make manual`. All the manual is compiled (this is time consuming); latex errors are displayed and the system wait for an answer (as usual you can enter x to continue). Note that the index is not updated.
  * in  `nsp2/man/html`, enter `make manual`. Use only this way when you are sure that the whole help compiles (otherwise latex errors freeze the compilation). The index is updated.
  * Jpc says: on obtient le man d'un example particulier en tapant `make` dans `nsp2/man/html-one` ou `make
  MANPAGE=model/model.tex` (par defaut on obtient le man de model).
